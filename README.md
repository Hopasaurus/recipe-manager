recipe-manager
==============

SoBeSC project number 1 - recipe management system while learning Rails.

Recipe application

The goal here is to do an end to end Rails application

We will store the sources in GitHub at:  ????


This we want to do:
  create a recipe - which is just a text file for now
	get a list of recipes...
	display the recipe
	edit recipes
	delete recipes
	search (string search of recipe text)
	pictures of final product add/remove...
	
Possible future enhancements
	split the ingredients off from the text into their own objects for enhance searching.
	users - CRUD
	sharing recipes
	
Things we will have to decide eventually
	where/how are the recipes going to be stored?
		plaintext files/database/dropbox
	backups
